# KnockKnockProtocol
cs352 program assignment 1

The purpose of assignment 1A was to create a GUI that would allow the client to send messages to a specified server. The GUI allows the user to input an IP Address and Port Number, send messages to the server, and see the replies sent from the server.

The purpose of assignment 1B was to create the server side of our KnockKnockProtocol program. Rather than running the knockknockprotocol, our server was to encrypt the client input using a Caesar shift pattern of C1C2C2C1C2, where C1 = 5 and C2 = 15. It would then return the encrypted message and sent it to the client. It was intended to use our GUI from 1A to communicate with this server.
